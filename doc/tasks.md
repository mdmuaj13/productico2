## üöÄ Development Tips

**API Development:**
- Use MongoDB aggregation pipeline for complex queries
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Set up API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- Use middleware for common operations (auth, logging)

**Frontend Development:**
- Create reusable UI components early
- Implement global state management for cart/user data
- Use Next.js API routes for client-side data fetching
- Optimize for mobile-first responsive design

**Database Considerations:**
- Design for eventual multi-tenant support
- Implement soft deletes for important records
- Create proper backup/restore procedures
- Monitor query performance as data grows
